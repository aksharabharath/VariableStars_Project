# VariableStars_Project

## Project Overview
This project analyzes variable star light curves from the ASAS-SN catalog. The goal is to visualize the brightness variations of different types of variable stars (RR Lyrae, Cepheid, Mira, and Eclipsing Binaries), compute basic features, and optionally classify or cluster them using Python.

## Folder Structure

- `data/` : Contains CSV files of downloaded light curves for 5 variable stars.
- `notebooks/` : Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks for analysis.
- `results/` : Plots, figures, and analysis output.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/VariableStars_Project.git
